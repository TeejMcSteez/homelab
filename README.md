# Setup

- automations
- scripts
- configurations

Custom components like the ring component are also their in need of another setup on complete loss. It is a cloned repo inside a another but can be found on my profile [HAWebRTCFix](github.com/TeejMcSteez/HAWebRTCFix).

Rest is stuff setup by HA, mainly used to be able to push and pull my config easily to other [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) container to test new core components like the Ring one.
